    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
            <h3>Cricket Score Predictor</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a machine learning model using <strong>Python, XGBoost, Pandas, and Scikit-learn</strong> 
      to forecast cricket scores based on historical match data. Implemented predictive algorithms to 
      estimate outcomes with high accuracy, incorporating diverse factors such as pitch conditions, 
      player statistics, and match environments. Designed a robust data processing pipeline to ensure 
      efficient handling of datasets and deliver reliable score predictions.

     <h3>Enhanced GAN-based Framework for Super Resolution of Satellite Images</h3>
    <p>
      Developed an advanced deep learning framework using <strong>SRGAN</strong> to enhance the resolution 
      of satellite imagery for applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster 
      management. Incorporated <strong>Dense Residual Blocks</strong> and <strong>Progressive Growing of the Generator</strong> 
      to improve image quality, feature extraction, and training stability. Experiments on the 
      <strong>DOTA dataset</strong> demonstrated significant improvements in <strong>PSNR</strong> and <strong>SSIM</strong>, achieving 
      high-fidelity image reconstruction with finer detail restoration.
